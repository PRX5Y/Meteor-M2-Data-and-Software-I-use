	-v.2.24 Found a bug in rare case if you specify an input dir in command line.
		Have managed to not have the big gap white in IR & pink in thermal.
		On compositions : corrected the transition when the image has a big gap.
		Added watermark option %hours% which write in composition the time span used. Should be use with the new option %textCompo%. (Thanks to 'Graham Hu' from Facebook "APT Group").
		Added Choice of font for watermark. The same font will be used for the text in the shapes. (Thanks to 'Thibaut Fouine' from Facebook "APT Group" & in real life)
			Pleas copy the font given in the zip (LemonMilk.otf). You can put the font you want.
		Added option to save the TLE with the name of the pass. As this you could treat an old .s file with the right tle. (not automatique, you have to rename the right tle file as M2_tle.txt or M2.2_tle.txt)
		Added the pass channels name (_123, _125,...) in the name of the file if you say yes at the option "saveTreated" in "Treatment" section.(Thanks to 'Filippo Pezzino' from Facebook "APT Group")
		Added the command line /h or /help to list all command line options.(Thanks to 'Carl Reinemann' from Facebook "APT Group")
		Added the option "saveGenericCompo" to save last composition with name like "LASTCOMPO_RGB.jpg". (Thanks to 'Carl Reinemann' from Facebook "APT Group")
		The configurator included in this zip is the version without shapes.
2019/11/21	
	Configurator v1.21. Read the README file included in the zip. For not alter Shapes options.
2019/11/18	
	-v.2.23 Correction of a bug : if no internet connection could not retrieve the last donwloaded TLE files.
2019/11/18	
	-v.2.22 Correction of a crash when a single pass image already exist and trying to make composition whith it. 
2019/11/17	
	-v.2.21 Correction of a crash when a pass is so bad that less than 3 APID bmp file was generated. Now if the APID count is not 3, skipping this image. 
			It's possible that this problem impact also the name & date/time on the watermark.
		Addition of a test if there is a new version of the program available .
		Separated the option useMeteorTime in 2 differents options, 1 for each sat. Become : "useMeteorTimeM2=yes" & "useMeteorTimeM22=no". The defaults values yes/no are what I'm thinking is good.
		
		Configurator v1.20
			Found a big bug when I update your ini file with new options and delete older one, sometimes this is not the right option wich is deleted.
2019/11/16	
	-v.2.20 Projection is now dot by dot instead of a copy of part of the image. Now without defaults, but more slow. Added antialiasing in both X & Y.
		Now no more need of 2 ini. Sat is automaticaly detected in auto mode. For manual mode (only for .s file) you need to specify the sat name (M2 or M2.2) whith the new command line /sat:
			And for composition, trying to retrieve the name of the sat(s) too, as each pass is now logged in the file passList.txt and if not found, trying by the folder name.
		On composition : watermark show only passes who are on the image.
		The files in Mercator projection are now saved whith "Mercator" suffix instead of "LatLon".
		Passes orders in compositions should now be ok. older first.
		Speed optimization of the shape drawing module.
		Changed the way the "no color" (black lines) are paint in the image : if no blacklines treatment => will not paint them; if treatment => will paint them.
		Added watermark option %sat% wich try to retrieve the name of the sat. If not found, put "Meteor M" as name.
		
		Configurator v1.10
			should now works with any type/order of shapes.
			Corrected a bug if you manually put a numeric value outside of the range I took it crash the configurator.
		
2019/10/31	
	-v.2.11 Bug in the configurator for the option watermark place (this is generated by MeteorGIS, not configurator). Resolved.
2019/10/31	
	-v.2.10 Now comes with the tool "MeteorGIS_Configurator.exe" who verify the .ini, and let you edit it more friendly. Try it !
		Rewrite of the projection principle.
		Completly rewrite of the soft transition of the images in compostion (not yet perfect, but not far).
		Added option for setting timespan to found the images for composition (default : 6 hours).
		Lot of bug correction.
		Trying to see if I could connect to Meteor Demodulator in TCP for knowing the sat, mode and eventually others options. Now M2_LRPT_Decoder is launched only when the signal of the pass is locked. Not yet in use.
		Have pre-worked on the possibility to create more projections for futur version.
		The new version should compose with images sorted by time of the pass (not pass longitude as before).
		New site to download this program and have infos : http:\\meteorgis.space Thanks to my friend Thibaut !

2019/10/23	
	-v.2.04 Forgot to revert a change I made : It could take a .jpg.gcp file in input file and crash !

2019/10/22		
	-v.2.03 A lot of problems with both sats / multiple type of APID. => Tried to correct it...

2019/10/22		
	-v.2.02 No RGB image made from APID 64-65-68 (IR) in day pass. => Corrected.

2019/10/21
	
	-v.2.01 As M2 switched to 125 and IR not functioning : change logic to make it work.
		Added 3 options for watermark : - projection, - apid, - version. See the default.ini, after you delete yours and generate a new one. 

2019/10/21

	-v.2.00 Complete rewrite of the projections function. Now the UTM is real UTM (not "My own" projection originally written for a limited user group) and LatLon is now Mercator projection limited to +/- 85° of latitude.
		Should not have "Out of memory" error anymore.
		The program is now compiled in 64 bits. You need a file "geomutil_libx64.dll" (it's included in the zip).
		Thanks to Graham Hu from Facebooks' APT Group for the translation/correction of the default.ini file.
		Thanks to all from Facebooks' APT Group (and others) who pointed out errors to me!

Version 2.xx

2019/10/17

	-v.1.32 Correction of a crash if you launch with an old default config (no one specified) introduced in the last version.
		Correction of 2 bugs when writing or updating ini, I accidentally put a "r" on the end of the line of the path where to save images for M2-2 in M2_LRPT_Decoder.ini

        -v.1.31 Added the save of one tle file when .ini launched. I take the name of the .ini given (else default) and save it with the name + "_tle.txt".

2019/10/16

	-v.1.30 Correction of the bug which crash the program with Out of Memory error. Seems to come from when a pass aproaches the pole, the (max_lon - min_lon) become bigger than 90°.
		Changed the way used for extracting the values from gcp file. I tried to change the local decimal separator in an US-EN dot. With this, we can exchange files between different locations around the world without MeteorGIS crashing.
