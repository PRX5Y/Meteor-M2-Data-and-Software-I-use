You can process .s file who are comming from the Meteor Demodulator plugin in SDRsharp, but with some limitations:

	-You can only treat recent file as you need valid tle for the date of the pass. Could be impossible to achieve for long time passes.
		If the tle are not valid, M2_LRPT_Decoder will not create the .gcp file or crash.
		
	-If your country have daylight saving time, the georeferencement will be bad if the pass was not in the same daylight saving time as now.
	
	-If you want to re-extract already extracted .s file, please delete first the already generated .gcp file.
