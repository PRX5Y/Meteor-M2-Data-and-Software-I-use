This version of Configurator (1.21) is the same as v1.20 but without any possibility to edit Shapes.
As the version 1.20 dosn't works if you change the number or order of defaults Shapes, you can use this configurator if you want to have not defaults Shape.
If you use defaults Shapes, better to keep the version 1.20 as it permit you to edit Shape.
