Welcome!

People like YOU can make this software as bug-free as it is possible.

What can you test:
  - translations support problems,
  - saving/loading satellite profiles,
  - Internet support (Time synch, TLE updater, Message Board),
  - behaviour of options (in setup, bottom panels, context menus...),
  - esthetics of interface and viewports,
  - running on misc system configurations (screen resolutions etc.),
  - working flexibility,
  - incomprehensible of options and statements,
  - language mistakes in interface and documentation (my English isn't perfect).
Remember, these are only examples, let me know about everything that seems 
to be wrong. Please use the form below to send me your bug reports. You can 
also send your suggestions and opinions. E-mail: sebastian@stoff.pl
